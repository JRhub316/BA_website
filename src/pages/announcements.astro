    <p>
      I am happy to announce that work on our new video is now in its beginning stages.   With the able assistance of media veterans Joel Katz and Harry Kafka, "A Song of Resistance: The Fight for Community Arts" is a video documentary that will explore the life and work of Jersey City cultural activist Daoud Williams (1943-2025).  By following the 55-year journey of Daoud's work in community arts, the video will explore such questions as: What exactly are community arts? What role do the arts play in creating community? What can we learn from Daoud's life-long work in community arts?
