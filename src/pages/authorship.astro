      Most of my writing has focused on the intersection of
      music, the arts and community. Over the years, I have dedicated myself to
      developing a style that is clear, coherent and, above all, understandable
      to the non-specialist.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have published two award winning books and scores of articles that run
      the musical gamut from Italian American doowop to bossa nova, from Andean
      religious festivals to the evolution of vaudeville and Tin Pan Alley. At
      the heart of it all is the idea that music and the arts form the basis of
      community.

      <i>The Technologizing of the Song</i> is the study I conducted for my doctoral
      dissertation while a student at NYU. During a seventeen-month period in 1988-1990,
      I conducted an ethnographic field study in a small town called Abadiania in
      the interior of Brazil. At the time of the study, only 30 percent of the rural
      homes in Abadiania had access to electrical current while older participants
      clearly remembered a time before any electricity existed at all. The study
      contrasts the observations I recorded of the musical life in Abadiania as it
      was currently experienced with the oral history reports of 40 individuals I
      collected in the town.

    <p>
      In surveying the history of Western music, <i>Mediating the Muse</i> seeks
      to uncover the essential nature of music as a form of communication dependent
      upon technological mediation. The book argues that all music, whether it be
      the rhythmic tapping of stones or the sophisticated coordination of a symphonic
      orchestra, is the result of applied technique and technological innovation
      that effects how we experience and conceptualize music.

    title='The Arts and Play as Educational Media in the Digital Age.'

    <p>
      Co-written with Carmine Tabone and based upon 40 plus years of experience
      working with children in Jersey City, <i>The Arts and Play as Educational
        Media in the Digital Age</i> outlines the ways in which hands-on experience in the arts and 
      face-to-face interpersonal forms of play help to re-establish a balance in the education and
      socialization of children as we enter more deeply into the Digital Age.

    <p>
      First prepared as a presentation at an academic convention in Italy, this
      article maintains that Italian American doowop groups in their adaptation
      of an African American form added something of their own cultural heritage
      to the mix. As descendants of recent immigrants from southern Italy, the
      singers of Italian American doowop were exposed to a rich musical
      tradition that included opera, bel canto singers, and a very vibrant
      tradition of popular song and public singing. All of this became
      integrated into their musical expression of doowop.

      Based on a field study I conducted with the assistance of the Chilean
      musicologist Professor Lina Barrientos Pacheco, this article examines the
      clash of pagan and Christian symbolism and practices within a ritual
      celebration known as “La Tirana” conducted every July in the Andean region
      of Northern Chile.
