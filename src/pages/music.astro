        “Practice any art, music, singing, dancing, acting, drawing, painting,
        sculpting, poetry, fiction, essays, reportage, no matter how well or
        badly, not to get money and fame, but to experience becoming, to find
        out what’s inside you, to make your soul grow.”

    Music has been the thread that has stitched my life together. I cannot even
    imagine my life without music, without playing the guitar, writing songs, or
    singing with other people.

    <p>
      I was born into an extended family that loved to sing songs and share
      stories. When I first showed an interest in learning the guitar, Aunt Flo
      patiently instructed me in the family repertoire of old Tin Pan Alley
      songs that she had learned to play on the piano by ear.

      One my first steps on the guitar was learning to play the four chords of
      doowop while singing with the neighborhood acapella group, The Majestics.

    <p>
      As a young man, I made a leap of faith and spent a year in Chile where I
      lived with a family of musicians. Without a radio or TV in the house, we
      sang every evening after dinner.

      Sitting and singing around tables in Brasil, I was introduced to bossa
      nova by friends who scribbled chord diagrams for me on the back of
      napkins. This is an announcement of a performance I shared with the
      renowned saxophonist and vocalist, Danny Bacher.

      Children <i>love</i> to sing! My 40 years of work with children taught me that
      young people should have the opportunity to sing every day, several times a
      day. Singing is an activity that brings joy and community into our lives.

      Besides lending books, public libraries have taken on the important role
      of building and sustaining community. Here I am at Greenville Library just
      a block away from the place where I was born, with my good friend Sam
      Williams, director of the Community Awareness Series.
